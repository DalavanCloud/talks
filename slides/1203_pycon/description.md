IPython provides tools for interactive and parallel computing that are
widely used in scientific computing, but can benefit any Python
developer.

We will show how to use IPython in different ways, as: an interactive
shell, an embedded shell, a graphical console, a network-aware VM in
GUIs, a web-based notebook with code, graphics and rich HTML, and a
high-level framework for parallel computing.
