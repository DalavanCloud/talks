# IPython talks

This repository holds materials for anyone wishing to give a talk about
IPython.  We are putting here commonly useful figures and previously presented
talks, as well as notebooks that are tailored for demonstration.

All materials in this repository are licensed CC-BY, and we encourage reuse!
As usual, for any improvements you make from a new talk, send us a pull
request.
